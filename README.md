# Final-Project

***Project Name: You can remove your life easily using the easy-to-get mushroom***

***What is the purpose of this project?***
- Recently, a lot of related news has disappeared, but there was news that hikers collected mushrooms grown on the hiking trail while hiking in the mountain and ate them incorrectly and were taken to the emergency room. Based on this, I thought of a project that allows people to understand what the color or characteristics of mushrooms are.
 
***Why we need this project***
- Suppose 100 people read a book to find mushrooms. I think I can save 99 people's time if I read and organize the book by myself. The file is also open source, which allows other people to add or change more information.
- The mushrooms that we see in the illustrated book(한국의 식용·독버섯도감/조덕현) could only be checked by putting information or knowing their names. So I made it easier to see what kind of mushrooms there were through the characteristics of the mushrooms that the user wanted to know, so that they could be more easily approached.
- Although I'm also an amateur, so people can't trust me very much, but I think it's an advantage that you can easily find mushrooms when you're curious about them.
 
***How to get start.***
- Download the mushroom.csv and finalproject.py file that i made and run finalproject.py than, it starts.
- Afterwards, if you select the case you want on the menu screen and enter it, the information of the mushroom is output.

***Limitation***
- I read the book and collected data, but i am not an expert.
- The size of the mushroom cap's diameter or stipe is based on the adult.
- Only 80 species native to Korea were compiled
- Rarely, but under the same features, the result of the mushroom sorted first is derived.
